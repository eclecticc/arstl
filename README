arstl is an Augmented Reality viewer for files used in 3D Printing
==================================================================
arstl lets you preview and interact with STL files in the real world before
committing an object to plastic by printing it out.  It uses the ArUco library
to track markers and OpenGL shaders to display the object being viewed.

Requirements
------------
ArUco http://www.uco.es/investiga/grupos/ava/node/26
OpenCV 2.1+
OpenGL 2.1+

Camera Calibration
------------------
Before using arstl, you'll need to find the intrinsic parameters of your camera.
The camera.yml included is an example from my Logitech 9000.  You can generate
your own using the calibration sample and checkerboard pattern included with
OpenCV.

Board Generation
----------------
ArUco includes utilities to generate markers and boards.  The board.abc and
board.png include are examples that you can use.

Usage
-----
Once you have a calibrated camera and a printed out board, you can run arstl
as follows:
arstl -y camera.yml -b board.abc -s 0.035 file.stl

License
-------
arstl.c is based on an ArUco sample.  ArUco states vaguely that it is under a
BSD license.  My changes are available under the ISC License.  The stlparser.c
file may be useful separately, so I'm putting it in the public domain.  The
shader files are directly from a lighthouse3d tutorial.
